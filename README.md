### Data Flow

1. **Quiz Data Loading**:
   - JSON quiz data is loaded either from:
     - Local storage (via `ManageQuizzes.js`)
     - Supabase (via `OnlineLibrary.js`)
   - Active quiz data is passed to `Quiz.js` via the `onQuizActivated` callback

2. **Quiz Execution Flow**:
   - Quiz data is processed and randomized using `shuffleArray` from `components/utils.js`
   - Questions are presented one at a time
   - User answers are validated immediately
   - Correct answers proceed automatically after a delay
   - Incorrect answers require manual progression and are added to a review list
   - After initial questions, incorrect questions are presented again
   - Final score is calculated and displayed

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - Local quizzes are stored in browser localStorage via the `useLocalStorage` hook
   - Online quizzes are stored in Supabase database via the Supabase client

### State Management

The application uses React's useState and useEffect hooks for state management:

**Main Quiz State** (`Quiz.js`):
- `currentQuestionIndex`: Tracks the current question position
- `selectedAnswer`: Stores the user's selected answer
- `showJustification`: Controls visibility of answer explanation
- `quizData`: Stores the active quiz data
- `randomizedQuestions`: Shuffled questions for presentation
- `correctAnswers`: Counter for correct answers
- `questionsToRepeat`: Collection of incorrectly answered questions
- `isInRepeatPhase`: Flag for the review phase of the quiz
- `isQuizComplete`: Flag for quiz completion state

**Quiz Management State**:
- `quizzes`: Array of available quizzes (from localStorage)
- `showManageQuizzes`: Controls quiz management interface visibility
- `showOnlineLibrary`: Controls online library interface visibility

**Online Library State**:
- Tracks loading states, selected quizzes, and deletion confirmation

## Using the App

### Taking a Quiz

1. Start by uploading a quiz file or selecting from the online library
2. Answer questions by clicking on an option or using the A, B, C keys
3. For correct answers, you'll automatically move to the next question
4. For incorrect answers, review the justification and click "Next Question"
5. After the initial round, you'll review any incorrect questions
6. View your final score and performance assessment when finished

### Managing Quizzes

- **Upload Quiz Files**: Click the upload icon in the management screen
- **Combine Quizzes**: Check multiple quizzes to activate them simultaneously
- **View Details**: Click the info icon to see all questions in a quiz
- **Delete Quizzes**: Click the trash icon (requires confirmation)

## Quiz File Format

Create JSON files with the following structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Quiz Title",
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "texte": "Your question text goes here?",
      "answerA": "First option",
      "answerB": "Second option",
      "answerC": "Third option",
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "justification": "Explanation for the correct answer"
    },
    // More questions...
  ]
}
```

Required fields:
- `title`: Name of the quiz
- `questions`: Array of question objects, each containing:
  - `id`: Unique identifier (auto-generated if missing)
  - `texte`: Question text
  - `answerA/B/C`: The three possible answers

  - `justification`: Explanation shown for incorrect answers

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment to Vercel:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Set proper environment variables in your deployment platform (like Vercel) for security. The application uses environment variables configured in `utils/supabaseClient.js` to access Supabase.
